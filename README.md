# tikiBar üçπ

Web app for finding and filtering top-notch tiki. A little bit on the structure of this projectt:
*  Back end: Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) & custom Python class for loading recipes and serving filtered recipes and ingredients based on input.
* Front end: Built with HTML, CSS, pure Javascript. 

### Background
In short, I love tiki drinks! The problem I often run into though is keeping up with all the syrups, rums, and liquers necessary to make any particular drink. I have a lot of great sources (*Smuggler's Cove*, *Easy Tiki*, etc.), but putting together those details with what I have on hand is time consuming. You mix these ingredients together, and you get the need for an app!  

### Process
My basic approach was to start with building a Python-based backend and a basic front end to interact with. I didn't involve database at this point as I'm working with a really small data source and will probabaly explore further as I go. Currently, the data file (manually copied ingredient details from books into parse matrix) gets loaded into my tiki bar Class which has functions for filtering and navigating Pandas Dataframe. The tiki bar Class is accessed through FastAPI. The front end was built to allow filtering recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand, and can create some wiggle in exactness of the recipe (can change whether you have exactly the right ingredients, or see other recipes where you are missing 1 or 2 ingredients)

### Current progress
Project does work as is, still with more tweaks and improvements on the way. The backend code can be documented better, front end has many possible improvements.

----
### Backlog
* Potentially refactor front end into React
* Add more views, such as see all recipes by one ingredient
* Create search to query by recipe name or ingredient name
* Make whole thing more mobile friendly. Current tabbed layout works best on desktop. Will need some more time to change UI
* Make live, write better details on how to deploy locally for others
